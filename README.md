## Opennurbs 3dm to Pixar Universal Scene Description Converter

### Experiment

You will need to build [rhino3dm python bindings](https://github/mcneel/rhino3dm.git) from source because the pip install version is missing a few things.

Of course also build / obtain [Pixar's USD stuff](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD)

Help is most welcome.
